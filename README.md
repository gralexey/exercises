Algorithm exercises

Exercises presented in C/C++/Objective-C languages and its combinations.

Content:


- AllPermutationsOfString.m

>Task: Design an algorithm to print all permutations of a string (like "abc" -> "cab", "acb", "abc", "cba", "bca", bac").


- MergeSort.m

>Merge sort implementation



- MyQueue.m

>Task: Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.



- PartitionLinkedListAroundX.m

>Task: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.



- SimpleStringCompression.m

>Task: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the orig- inal string, your method should return the original string.



- SortStackWithSupportingStack.m

>Task: Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order (with biggest items on top). You may use at most one additional stack to hold items, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (suchasan array).The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.



- SpacesToProc20.m

>Task: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with'%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if imple- menting in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this opera- tion in place.)
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith Output: "Mr%20Dohn%20Smith"



- StringBufferImplementation.m

>Just my StringBuffer implementation to train. Methods: append & string â€” to append string to buffer & get result string


- SumTwoLinkedLists.m

>Task: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the Ts digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input:(7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).Thatis,617 + 295.
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9.That is, 912.
FOLLOW UP
Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem. EXAMPLE
Input:(6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).Thatis,617 + 295.
Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2.That is, 912.



- TransposeMatrixInPlace.m

>Task: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
